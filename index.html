    <h1 class="title">Does Masks Really Saves Us From COVID-19??</h1>
    
        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted many parts of our lives and changed the world in many aspects as well. 
          Before, during and even after the pandemic was over, wearing a mask was REQUIRED by many goverments around the globel
           to help reduce the spread of the virus and aims to slow down the number of positive cases confirmed each day.
           However, there are people who do not believe that the mask will work as expected, 
           but there are also people who are wearing extra layers of them to make sure they are safe from the virus.
           In the next few visulizations, we will try to use data to help us understand does masks really saves us from COVID-19.
