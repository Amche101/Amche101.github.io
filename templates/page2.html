    <h1 class="title">Covid Cases and Use of Masks</h1>
    
    <p>
      From social media, government and our education program. We were told that uses of 
      masks can help us stay away from the COVID-19 virus, but it also help us stop spreading it.<br>


      However in this visulization, we see that this is may not be the case and also a few exceptions. 
      We see that New York and California has a significantly high number of both positive cases and mask usages.
      This could also be explantined by their massive population and tourism right before the pandemic started.<br>
      There were also two states that helped to support the original theroy that masks saves lifes.<br>
      In Vermont we see only 8000 positive cases!! But as we can tell, their mask uses are a lot higher than states that has more positive cases towards the middle.<br>
      In Hawaii we also see that with only 22k positive cases, their mask useage are also very high which could've be the reason why these two states are having suck low positive rate.
